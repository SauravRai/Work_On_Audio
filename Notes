In this page, I will sharing all the links and channels that I have used while learning different concepts.

1. Signals and Systems from Khan academy  
https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-signals

Note about this video lectures:
Signals and Systems covers analog and digital signal processing, ideas at the heart of modern communication and measurement. 
They present the basic concepts for continuous-time and discrete-time signals in the time and frequency domains. 
Time and frequency are related by the Fourier transform. 

2.  Various concepts related to DSP

3. Understanding the Fixed Point Representation, Q factor and addtion
