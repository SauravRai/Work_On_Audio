Recently I have started working on Audio signals (Digital Signal Processing) which is completely new to my Domain. 
I will be sharing all my learnings, the tools that I will be using (links to download) and the links of the blogs that I will write. 

Links persent:
1. Signals and Systems from Khan academy
2. Various concepts related to DSP 
3. Understanding the Fixed Point Representation, Q factor and addtion
4. Two's complement represenattion theory and examples
5. Fixed Point Multiplication
6. What is Swig and why does it being used?
7. 9 Best File Comparison and Difference (Diff) Tools for Linux

Setting up the tools:
1. Downloading Oceanaudio
2. About the Tensilica HiFi DSP 

There are 3 ways we can download softwares in Ubuntu: (1) From the Ubuntu store, (2) Using the "sudo dpkg -i package_to_insttall.deb" after downloading from the source
and (3) "sudo apt-get install package.deb" directly from the command line if the .deb is avaiable
