1. The DSP – digital signal processor – is the 'brain' inside an active speaker. It takes audio information (converting it to digital format if necessary) and manipulates the ones 
and zeroes to achieve a desired effect.

Why DSP is used and what does it an edge in simple devices?
What is the difference between DSP and CPU?

2. Codecs are essentially standards of video content compression. Codecs are made up of two components, an encoder to compress the content, and a decoder to decompress the video content and play an approximation of the original content. An enCOder and a DECoder, hence the name codec

Snippets from the video link

a. Microcontrollers are used in applications where the tasks given are predefined (example. cameras, washing machine, oven), and micro processors are used in personal laptops where the tasks are not preddefined and can be used for various other applications. 

b. In case of the microprocessors, all the other things such as memory(RAM, ROM), IO ports, Serial interface are connected to it externally.  
   Since the microcontrollers are for the specfic tasks, the amount of the memory and other ports are limited. They are all integrated along with the single CPU in a single chip.

c. Microprocessor
   Clock speed: 1GHz to 4GHz
   RAM: 512 MB up to 32 GB
   ROM: 128 GB to 2TB 
   Peripheral: USB
   Interfaces: HIGH Speed Ethernet UART
   There are 32 and 64 bit microprocessors. 32 bit of data can be handled at the same time. Address and the data bus are of the 32 or 64 bits 
    
   Microcontroller
   Clock speed: 1MHz up to 300MHz
   RAM: 2KB to 256kb
   Flash Memory: 32KB to 2MB
   Peripheral: I2C 
   Interfaces: SPI UART
   There are 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers    
      
d. What is Flash Memory and I2C: 
   Flash memory, also known as flash storage, is a type of nonvolatile memory that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. Flash memory is widely used for storage and data transfer in consumer devices, enterprise systems and industrial applications.   
   The I2C bus interface serves as an interface between the microcontroller and the serial I2C bus
   
e. Difference between Peripheral and Interface  
Input-Output Interface is used as an method which helps in transferring of information between the internal storage devices i.e. memory and the external peripheral device . A peripheral device is that which provide input and output for the computer, it is also called Input-Output devices.
